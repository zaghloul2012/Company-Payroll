# Company Payroll

Payroll is the compensation a business must pay to its employees and invoices
It is usually managed by the accounting or human resources department of a company.

## Usage

You can try the program from the main.py file in the root directory

## Motivation 

I tried to apply my knowledge in a real-world project and to build the structure of 
the project from scratch instead of writing all the project in one file

## Project Description

We need to represent a company payroll so I used the OOD to represent entities and their relationships:  
Working people: Volunteers or Employees  
Employees are paid based on their type  
        1- hourly based 
        2- salaried based.
        3- commision salaried employee 

There are invoices: each invoice has a set of items 

The payroll consists of a payables list (employee or invoice)

The total paid money is the total paid money for the added employees and invoices
